This is a very rough draft.
Basically pointers of what I have to say to anyone who wants to run .NET using CLI and on VS Code

Here's how you can too.

dotnet new webapi

How you can know how to do it
dotnet new -l

dotnet new gitignore

Install a few extensions 
C#  -   Autocomplete and stuff
C# Extensions - Helps you create classes, interfaces, controllers etc using gui (It creates the template for you)
Nuget Gallery - This helps you install NuGet packages very similarly to how you install it in Visual Studio

dotnet new tool-manifest
dotnet tool install dotnet-ef
